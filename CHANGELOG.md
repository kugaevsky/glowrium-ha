# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **State is now reported on models whose property map spans more than one frame.**
  A device frame may declare more CBOR pairs in its map header than it carries — a
  G8 sends 55 bytes headed `0xac`, promising 12 pairs and containing 11 — and the
  decoder discarded the whole frame, so every state entity read `unknown` while the
  lamp still responded to commands. The pairs that did arrive are now kept. Thanks
  to [@pentafive](https://github.com/pentafive), who diagnosed this on a G8 and sent
  the fix ([#5](https://github.com/kugaevsky/glowrium-ha/pull/5)).
- **State is primed by reading `facebd02` instead of asking the lamp to report.**
  One read returns the whole property map. The old request-write is unreliable on
  some models — a G8 answers it with ATT `Insufficient authorization`, a
  not-connected error or a timeout, and drops the link while doing so — and because
  the connect path also runs from the command path, that tore down the connection on
  every command. The request is now only a fallback, tried once and never re-sent
  after a rejection.
- **Changing one schedule field no longer overwrites the other four.** The `0x11`
  slot packs the enabled flag, both times, brightness and fade into a single write,
  so substituting a default to change one of them silently rewrote the rest and
  forced the schedule on. Setting the ramp likewise no longer resets the lighting
  mode to preset 1. Both now refuse with an explanation until the device has
  reported the field.
- **The light reports `unknown` rather than a confident `off`** before its state has
  been read.
- A command sent to an out-of-range device no longer appears to hang: `_async_write`
  is capped at 15 s (covering the wait for the connection lock, which a background
  reconnect may hold) and `establish_connection` is limited to 2 attempts instead of
  bleak-retry-connector's default 4. Previously bleak's own retries could stack up for
  over a minute before the button in the UI reported anything.
- Command failures are now raised as a translated `HomeAssistantError` ("out of range
  or the Bluetooth adapter is busy; a Bluetooth proxy near the device usually fixes
  this") instead of surfacing a raw `BleakError` stack trace.
- The refusal shown when a field has not been reported yet is translated too, in all
  six supported languages — it was the last hard-coded English message.

### Changed

- A frame dropped for carrying trailing bytes is now logged as itself, with the
  model, firmware, byte count and frame hex, once per session as a warning rather
  than buried at debug level among ordinary undecodable frames. Rejecting such
  frames is new, and on a model that never produced them this is where a regression
  would surface.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-20

Internal robustness and maintainability release — no change to entities or behaviour.

### Fixed

- BLE commands are now serialized on the connection lock and retried once across a
  reconnect, so a command sent during the device's periodic (~30–60 min) GATT
  reconnect no longer surfaces an error to the caller.

### Changed

- Extracted the semantic byte-layout codec into `protocol.py` — the `0x11` schedule
  slot and `0x2f` ramp conversions previously lived in three places. The coordinator
  now exposes typed read accessors, and entities read those instead of the raw
  device-state dict.

### Added

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — a public protocol/architecture reference and a step-by-step
  guide to adding another Glowrium model; linked from the README and CONTRIBUTING.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-19

Initial public release.

### Added

- Local **Bluetooth** control of the INLEDCO Glowrium G7 grow light — no cloud, no vendor app.
- `light` — on/off and brightness (0–100 %).
- `select` — operating mode (Manual / Circadian / Schedule) and lighting mode (8 circadian presets).
- `number` — ramp time, schedule gradual and schedule brightness.
- `time` — schedule start / end.
- `switch` — indicator LED and DST.
- `button` — Sync location (pushes Home Assistant's home coordinates; the device recomputes its
  own circadian curve).
- Diagnostic `sensor` (latitude / longitude) and `binary_sensor` (activation status).
- Local activation handshake that brings up a factory-reset lamp without the vendor app.
- Multi-model registry (`models.py`) keyed by the device-info `pkey`, with per-model name, icon
  and circadian presets.
- Automatic Bluetooth discovery of `Glowrium-*` devices.
- Translations: en, ru, zh-Hans, es, de, fr.
